      <h3>Here's a time line of Mark's career:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>1984</b> – Born in White Plains, New York, the only son of a dentist and psychiatrist (he has three sisters).</li>
        <li><b>2002</b> – Graduates from Phillips Exeter Academy, a private school in New Hampshire; joins Harvard University in autumn on a psychology and computer science course.</li>
        <li><b>2003</b> – Launches Facemash - a web programme enabling Harvard students to compare images of same-gender students and rate the more attractive - and nearly gets kicked out when its immediate popularity draws the attention of the university
          administrators.</li>
        <li><b>2004</b> – Starts Thefacebook.com in February.</li>
        <li><b>2004</b> – Drops out of Harvard at the end of his sophomore year; moves to Palo Alto that summer, where he rents a house with a now-famous swimming pool (and zip-wire). </li>
        <li><b>2004</b> – Facebook hits 200,000 users; contacts venture capitalists in Silicon Valley, and receives an initial investment of half a million dollars - some of which is used to splash out on a small office above a Chinese restaurant. </li>
        <li><b>2004</b> – The Winklevoss twins file a lawsuit against Zuckerberg claiming he ripped off their idea for a new social network, HarvardConnection (later ConnectU).</li>
        <li><b>2005</b> – Facebook hits 5 million users.</li>
        <li><b>2006</b> – At 22 years of age, Zuckerberg turns down an estimated $1 billion dollar offer for Facebook from Yahoo.</li>
        <li><b>2007</b> – Opens Facebook beyond universities so anyone with an email address can join; turns down a $15 billion offer from Microsoft, which would have bagged him personally $4 billion.</li>
        <li><b>2007</b> – Allows independent developers to write programmes for Facebook; but is forced to apologise when Beacon, a controversial new addition to Facebook allowing users to view what their friends have been buying online, raises major complaints
          over privacy intrusion.</li>
        <li><b>2008</b> – Reaches a settlement with Winklevoss lawsuit worth $65 million, though still denies any intellectual property theft.
          <li><b>2009</b> – China blocks domestic access to Facebook.</li>
          <li><b>2010</b> – Named Time magazine’s person of the year.</li>

          <li><b>2011</b> – Facebook records half a billion users on Facebook in a single day, and is expected to report $4 billion dollars revenue, double that of the previous year.
            <li><b>2012</b> – Facebook projected to reach 1 billion users; a much-mooted stock market flotation would be expected to earn as much as $100 billion.</li>
